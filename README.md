## Hello in my first bigger project in Java. 

I am creating this program for people who like play in Tibia and often have to create new accounts :D 

This code will create an account for you on Tibia.com and Interia.pl, confirm your email and enter your R'Key.
Finally, it will save the login details in a text file in MyDocuments.

The program uses Selenium WebDriver to manage the browser.

## A browser installed on your computer is required for the program to work properly.

## Supported browsers:  Google Chrome✅, FireFox❌, Opera❌, Internet Explorer❌
    
❇️ *How to use it?*

‼️ *Requirements:*

- **You need install Java on your computer.** *You can download it from here [Oracle Java](https://www.oracle.com/pl/java/technologies/downloads/)*
